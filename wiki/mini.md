# Da Rulz (MiniHunt)

**MiniHunt** is a new game mode for bite-sized gameplay. The goals are slightly different in MiniHunt.

## THE GOALS:
A specific Star is assigned, and everyone is warped to that act.
  - Runners collect the star named at the bottom of the screen. Use the radar to help locate the star, if applicable.
  - Hunters must defeat Runners to become Runners. **Only Runners can collect stars.**
After the star is collected, a new Star is assigned.
After 5 minutes (or some other time), whoever collects the most Stars wins!

## FREE FOR ALL:
This mode is a Free For All. Hunters should work together, but once you're Runner, you're on your own.
Only one Runner can collect the star. **Runners may even attack each other.**

## SKIPPING STARS:
What if the Star is too hard, with no end in sight? If that's the case, use **/skip** to vote to skip this star. Half the lobby must agree.

## SUPER DYING SKILLS
Runners take two (2) extra points of damage any time they get attacked. Be careful!

## What Stars are assigned?
Every star in the game is eligible, with the following exceptions:
  - No castle stars (toad, mips)
  - No 100 coin stars
  - No stars that are too quick (In The Deep Freeze, Mysterious Mountainside)
  - Other stars that worsen the MiniHunt experience

To view or manage the blacklist, go to **MiniHunt Blacklist** under **Game Settings**.

That's all you need to know for MiniHunt!
